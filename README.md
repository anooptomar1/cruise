Cruise

iOS game - Control environment around vehicle traveling through a series of experiences and trials affecting vehicle's trajectory and velocity.

Bounce from geoid to geoid. 

Camera postion, orientation:
    Cam -> Vehicle -> Geoid: look at vehicle, position has vehicle between geoid center and camera
    Cam -> Geoid: look at geoid, positioned on vector from geoid through

    Look at vehicle but camera's position is a function of geoid and vehicle positions, somewhere in between, or just behind vehicle at all times.



Self organizing entities
* They adjust their own physics bodies in response to external stimulus
* Like the seed planting swarm, an individual unit (called a surface unit) will seek a patch to plant a seed by checking proximity to other seeds or plants. 
* it'll attract other surface units if density is low
* it'll repel other surface units if density is high



How to start?
* Start with a finite number of particles to release into a field planted by self organizing autonomous surface units. 

* Once the crop is scattered, start the growth simulation. Seeds grow into elongated shapes,
